    <img src="Screenshot_2025-06-25-01-50-38-68.jpg" alt="Kamakshi" width="150" style="border-radius: 50%;">
    <p>Hi there! I'm Kamakshi and this is my first time creating a website where I blog and maybe live. I'm 18 and I'm very much interested in gaming and doing nothing but also a little bit of coding. I love making friends, and in person I maybe an extrovert but I'm not much confident if you ask me but that's ok. That's how life works right!?. I might not be perfect and neither is this website but I hope y'all like it üôÇ. Thanks for being here. Toddles!</p>

    <h2>Blog 1 ‚ô•Ô∏è</h2>
    <pre>Its been a rough day and while blaming god for everything that's happening in my life I realised what the actual problem was 
      and so here I'm discussing about THE REAL PROBLEM......with this poem----->
      There's nothing more important to me than to be... to live...to feel
      but still the question echoes: is it truly necessary? Alone without love, no tender care to cradle my heart, seeking souls to halt this solitude,
      but shadows chase me still, like demons dancing in the dark of my restless mind.
      The world once sparkled bright in solitary glow,
      but now I'm encircled by strangers whose hearts are void, each glance a dagger, every word a wound, they bury my hope deeper than any weapon can wound.
      Innocence was my shroud, believing in binds of closeness, convincing myself it‚Äôs me, 
      that I‚Äôm the flaw, but no, no, no‚Äî I‚Äôm just a marionette, strings pulled for their delight, 
      yet I‚Äôve grown; perhaps my heart remains a timid child, screaming silently, longing to cry,
      longing to be whole, and still I know, the mirror reflects the problem within me, cause yes! the problem is me.....

    <h2>Blog 2 ‚ô•Ô∏è</h2>
    <pre>I've been realising lately that everything I do will never be enough or maybe...... I'M NOT ACTUALLY DOING ENOUGH------>

Crying in silence, running through pain, Screaming inside like a voice in the rain. I've given my all, done more than I could, Yet still I'm unseen, misunderstood.

For those that I love, I‚Äôve carried the weight, Faced every storm, surrendered to fate. But they look at me with eyes so cold, And I‚Äôm lost in stories I've already told.

Lost in the past, in shadows I flee, Trapped in a place I never wished to be. I wonder aloud‚Äîwhat do I desire? When did my soul lose its fire?

I‚Äôve become someone I never planned, A stranger shaped by unseen hands. Not cruel, not heartless, not a foe‚Äî Just tired, just broken, moving slow.

They say I‚Äôm wrong, they think I‚Äôm weak, But maybe I‚Äôm just too soft to speak. Maybe my love was never enough To heal the cracks, to smooth the rough.

I‚Äôve searched within, I‚Äôve tried my best, But some battles don‚Äôt end in rest. Now I stand with nothing left to prove, Just the ache of all I couldn‚Äôt move.

So if I seem like I‚Äôm drifting apart, Know it‚Äôs not hate‚Äîit‚Äôs a heavy heart. I gave my all, yet here I stand, Still wondering if I was ever enough... in anyone‚Äôs hands......
